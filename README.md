# **README-Generator**

## **Objective**

The task was to create a README Generator that came loaded with pre-outlined prompts for user input. In order to create this functionality, I needed to utilize JS, JSON, Axios, gitignore, and Node Modules. All concepts were foreign to me aside from JS. 

In order to make the README look more polished, I needed to "master" markdown syntax for professionalism and readability.
