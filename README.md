# **README-Generator**

## **Objective**

The task was to create a README Generator that came loaded with pre-outlined prompts for user input. In order to create this functionality, I needed to utilize JS, JSON, Axios, gitignore, and Node Modules. All concepts were foreign to me aside from JS. 

In order to make the README look more polished, I needed to "master" markdown syntax for professionalism and readability. 

## **Requirements**

This README Generator needed to meet the following requirements:

* At least one badge
* Project title
* Description
* Table of Contents
* Installation
* Usage
* License
* Contributing
* Tests
* Questions
  * User GitHub profile picture
  * User GitHub email
