# **README-Generator**

## **Objective**

The task was to create a README Generator that came loaded with pre-outlined prompts for user input. In order to create this functionality, I needed to utilize JS, JSON, Axios, gitignore, and Node Modules. All concepts were foreign to me aside from JS. 

In order to make the README look more polished, I needed to "master" markdown syntax for professionalism and readability. 

## **Requirements**

This README Generator needed to meet the following requirements:

* Create a command-line application that dynamically generates a README.md from a user's input
* Include at least one badge
* Project title (Info)
* Project Description (Info)
* Table of Contents (Info)
* Installation (How-to)
* Usage (How-to)
* License (Info)
* Contributing (Info)
* Tests (Info)
* Questions:
  * User GitHub profile picture
  * User GitHub email
